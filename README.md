![Project Banner](./media/banner.png)

## üèÜ NEST Hackathon Experience

Our team had an amazing experience at the NEST Hackathon 2025, where we developed RASPI-240: a comprehensive industrial monitoring and security system. This solution combines IoT sensors, machine learning, and web technologies to create a holistic approach to industrial safety and efficiency.

## üìã Project Overview

RASPI-240 is an integrated system that provides:

- **Access Control**: RFID badge-based security for restricted areas
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Real-time temperature tracking with alerts
- **Facial Recognition**: AI-powered authentication for administrators
- **Failure Prediction**: Machine learning algorithms for preventive maintenance
- **Dashboard**: Web interface for monitoring and managing all systems
