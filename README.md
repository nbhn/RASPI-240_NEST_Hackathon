## 🏆 NEST Hackathon Experience

Our team had an amazing experience at the NEST Hackathon 2025, where we developed RASPI-240: a comprehensive industrial monitoring and security system. This solution combines IoT sensors, machine learning, and web technologies to create a holistic approach to industrial safety and efficiency.

## 📋 Project Overview

RASPI-240 is an integrated system that provides:

- **Access Control**: RFID badge-based security for restricted areas
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Real-time temperature tracking with alerts
- **Facial Recognition**: AI-powered authentication for administrators
- **Failure Prediction**: Machine learning algorithms for preventive maintenance
- **Dashboard**: Web interface for monitoring and managing all systems

## 🧩 System Components

Our solution consists of several interconnected components:

### 1. RFID Access Control
Arduino-based system for controlling access to restricted areas using RFID badges. [Details](./docs/rfid_access.md)

### 2. Temperature Control
Multi-sensor temperature monitoring system with alerting capabilities. [Details](./docs/temperature_control.md)

### 3. MQTT Bridge
Node.js service that connects hardware components to our Supabase database using MQTT protocol. [Details](./docs/mqtt_bridge.md)

### 4. Face Recognition System
AI-powered facial recognition system for administrator authentication. [Details](./docs/face_recognition.md)

### 5. Failure Prediction System
Machine learning models for predicting equipment failures before they occur. [Details](./docs/failure_prediction.md)

### 6. Web Dashboard
React-based web interface that provides real-time monitoring and control of all system components. [Details](./docs/web_dashboard.md)
